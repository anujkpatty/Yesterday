# Yesterday

Yesterday is a mobile social media app built using React-Native and a Node.js and Express.js backend. The backend is built with a sqlite  database. Yesterday is supposed to be a minimalist take on social media while allowing only one post per day. The idea is that after you have gone about your day and taken any pictures you can upload 2-10 pictures to the app which will be formatted into a rotating gif with each picture appearing for .75 seconds until transitioning to the next. This post doesn't go live to your friends until midnight, hence the name "Yesterday". The next day you will be able to see all the posts your friends made from the previous day. This feed will only last for 24 hours and posts will be archived after that.

## Installation

Clone the repo and install all dependencies.  Use 'npm start' in server to run the backend. Then, use 'npx expo start' to run the client in client-mobile.
